Sodoku function:

My logic trough the solution
 was to split it  into these functions : 

A ‪ function finds the next empty-non zero place
 in the board‬ if there is it returns true else it returns false 

I built few different functions to check if the 
current place in the board is valid to put a
 particular number in it- according to the sudoku game rules 

The first function from this kind  checks if
 the number in the current place exists twice or more in the same row

The second  checks if the number in the 
current place exists twice or more in the same column

And the third  function checks if the 
current place is passed sub-board 
rule which means it is the only value of its kind in  its sub board

I used these three function together 
 to create a main function to check if the current place is valid 

After finish to build these helper 
functions I create the main function
 that actually solve a general board sudoku game 

   This function is boolean function checks 
if a general N*N board sudoku game is
 solvable and if it is ,it solves it in this way:
     If there is no empty(zero) location, we are done==>
==> else  consider digits 1 to N for the first empty location 
‪      ‬==>‪ if it's valid so far‬ go to next 
recursive call fo the next empty cell
 ,if in some point it's not valid so back track


In addition the file contain the following functions :

    A function that prints all subsets with size k of the group 0...,n-1

    A function that returns list with all subsets 
with size k of the group 0...,n-1 as lists without taking any lists parameters

    A function that fills an empty list with all
 subsets with size k of the group 0...,n-1 as lists and return nothing
